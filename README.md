# My First Bundle

<<<<<<< HEAD
Have you ever wondered what an application architecture would look like if you committed to using mostly all graduated or incubating projects from the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://www.cncf.io/projects/)? This repo, the **[CNCF](https://www.cncf.io/) Projects App**, attempts to answer that question with an example expense application that is made up almost exclusively of CNCF projects.

## Overview
The CNCF Projects App project and application is not to be considered a reference architecture for any of the CNCF projects in use, but to serve as an "art of the possible" with the goal of using as many CNCF projects as possible to create a functional real world application. The project goal to encourage new people venturing into the world of open source, and specifically the CNCF community, to participate and provide high-level guidance on what each CNCF project capablities are and how the project can function for a true business application. We hope this sample application becomes a reference starting point for those getting started in the open source community, as well as seasoned maintainers and contributors to work along on this project to extend it in various scenarios.



## CNCF Projects App Overview
The CNCF Projects App is a sample expense application simulating a user submitting an expense report. The application consists of the following components:

* [GitHub](https://github.com/) - Code Repository
* [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) - Dashboard
* [Harbor](https://goharbor.io/) - Container Registry (CNCF)
* [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/) - Observability/Tracing (CNCF)
* [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) - Container Orchestration Cluster (CNCF)
* [Linkerd](https://linkerd.io/) - Service Mesh (CNCF)
* [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) - Database
* [NATS](https://nats.io/) - Pub/Sub Messaging (CNCF)
* [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/) - Kubernetes Ingress Controller
* [OpenFaaS](https://www.openfaas.com/) - Functions
* [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) - Monitoring (CNCF)
* [Rook](https://rook.io/) - Storage Management (CNCF)
* [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/) - Email Service
* [Tekton](https://tekton.dev/) CI/CD (CD Foundation)
* Web Front-End & Web API - [.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/about)

This is an empty bundle that porter has created to get you started!

# Contents

## porter.yaml
>>>>>>> first version

This is the porter manifest. See https://porter.sh/author-bundles/ for 
details on every field and how to configure your bundle. This is a required
file.

<<<<<<< HEAD
## CNCF Projects App Architecture
Below is the documented CNCF Projects App architecture for reference.
=======
## helpers.sh
>>>>>>> first version

This is a bash script where you can place helper functions that you can call
from your porter.yaml file.

<<<<<<< HEAD
## Install
As of now please follow the instructions [here](notes.md) in sequence to deploy the CNCF Projects App in your environment. We are currently working on both a [Helm](https://helm.sh/) and [CNAB](https://cnab.io/) installation of the repo. 
=======
## README.md
>>>>>>> first version

This explains the files created by `porter create`. It is not used by porter and
can be deleted.

## Dockerfile.tmpl

<<<<<<< HEAD
## Contributing
This project welcomes contributions and suggestions. 
=======
This is a template Dockerfile for the bundle's invocation image. You can
customize it to use different base images, install tools and copy configuration
files. Porter will use it as a template and append lines to it for the mixin and to set
the CMD appropriately for the CNAB specification. You can delete this file if you don't
need it.

Add the following line to **porter.yaml** to enable the Dockerfile template:

```yaml
dockerfile: Dockerfile.tmpl
```

By default, the Dockerfile template is disabled and Porter automatically copies
all of the files in the current directory into the bundle's invocation image. When
you use a custom Dockerfile template, you must manually copy files into the bundle
using COPY statements in the Dockerfile template.

## .gitignore

This is a default file that we provide to help remind you which files are
generated by Porter, and shouldn't be committed to source control. You can
delete it if you don't need it.

## .dockerignore

This is a default file that controls which files are copied into the bundle's
invocation image by default. You can delete it if you don't need it.
